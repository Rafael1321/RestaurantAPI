# RestaurantAPI
Database Management Systems Class Project

Small restaurants in our communities are experiencing an increase in the information that they need to keep track of and many do not manage and store this information properly.
Most small restaurants keep data on paper files which are prone to getting damaged or lost and are very difficult to organize. Most of the time, this lack of organization leads
owners to close the doors of their restaurants. This negatively impacts the economy of our communities because these small restaurants generate money and jobs for locals.
As small companies have limited resources, it is hard for them to outsource third-party companies for the management of their data as they charge expensive fees.

With the objective of providing these services we: 

* Worked in a team of three to create fully functional Web API using ASP.net (C#) tailored to the needs of small restaurants.
* Utilized a Postgres database to store all the required data (ex: customer, employee, dish, supplier information...) 
* Used Heroku to host the Postgres database
* Utilized SQL stored-procedures to avoid security breaches such as SQL injections.
* Created documentation for API using the Postman tool [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13792619/TVmS9FgQ]
